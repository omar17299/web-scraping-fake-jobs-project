This project is a simulated job listings database designed for learning, testing, and demonstration purposes. It generates a collection of fake job postings with realistic attributes such as job title, company name, location, salary range, job type, and description.

The main goals of this project are:

To practice data handling, storage, and visualization without using real personal or company data.

To test web applications, dashboards, or scraping tools safely using mock data.

To provide a ready-to-use dataset for experiments in Python, SQL, or data science projects.

Features:

Generates hundreds of fake job entries automatically.

Stored in structured formats like CSV, JSON, or directly in databases.

Easy to extend or customize for different use cases.

This project is perfect for developers, data engineers, or students looking to experiment with job-related datasets safely and efficiently.
